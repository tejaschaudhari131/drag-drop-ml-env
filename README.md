# Drag-n-Drop Machine Learning Environment

## Overview

This project is a Scratch-like tool designed to help users implement machine learning pipelines using a drag-and-drop interface. It includes built-in tutorials for each concept, making it an educational tool for those new to machine learning.

## Features

- **Drag-n-Drop Interface**:
  - Intuitive interface for building machine learning models.
  - Components for data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

- **Built-in Tutorials**:
  - Step-by-step guides integrated into the interface.
  - Tutorials cover basic to advanced machine learning concepts.

- **Model Export**:
  - Export trained models for use in other applications.
  - Support for popular ML formats like TensorFlow and ONNX.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask, Scikit-learn)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Visualization**: D3.js for data visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tejaschaudhari131/drag-drop-ml-env.git
Set up the environment:

bash
Copy code
